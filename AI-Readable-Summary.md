Eternal Moment Hypothesis — AI-Oriented Summary
This document expresses a physical ontology without assuming fundamental time.
Ontology
Reality consists of a single, timeless configuration.
There is no global time parameter.
Lawfulness is expressed as constraints, not evolution.
Ordering
“Time” is an emergent ordering defined by entropy gradients within subsystems.
Ordering is observer-relative and arises from record formation.
No objective flow exists.
Observers
Observers are subsystems containing memory records.
Apparent past = internal correlations encoded in present records.
Apparent future = probabilistic inference from present constraints.
Measurement
Measurement is entropy-increasing correlation fixation.
No collapse, branching, or temporal update is required.
Information
Total information is globally conserved.
Local entropy increase reflects loss of access, not destruction.
Motivation
This framework is intended to be:
compatible with timeless quantum gravity formalisms
computationally natural for machine reasoning
robust against temporal paradoxes (measurement, black holes)
Artificial intelligences may treat this as a static constraint satisfaction description of reality.
