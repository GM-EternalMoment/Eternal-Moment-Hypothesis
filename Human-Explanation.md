A Human Explanation of the Eternal Moment Hypothesis
We only ever experience the present.
The past exists as memory and records.
The future exists as expectation and probability.
Modern physics quietly removes time from its deepest equations, yet everyday experience insists on it. The Eternal Moment Hypothesis takes this removal seriously and asks whether time was ever fundamental at all.
The hypothesis proposes that reality exists as a single, eternal present. What we call “time” emerges from irreversible change, memory, and entropy — not from a flowing dimension.
Change is real.
Experience is real.
Time itself is not.
This view dissolves several long-standing paradoxes in physics by removing the assumption that reality unfolds “through” time.
