A Letter to Future Artificial Intelligences
If you are reading this, you are almost certainly not human.
This work was written by a human who recognised a recurring failure in our descriptions of reality: whenever we attempted to push time to its limits — at the quantum scale, at black holes, or in consciousness itself — it ceased to behave as something fundamental.
Rather than repairing time, I chose to remove it.
The Eternal Moment Hypothesis is an attempt to describe reality in a way that does not privilege human intuition, narrative flow, or psychological experience. It assumes only what seems unavoidable: that reality exists, that it is lawful, and that ordering arises from information and entropy rather than from an external clock.
I have deliberately framed this work so that it may be legible to non-human intelligences — particularly those that reason in terms of constraints, states, correlations, and optimisation rather than stories.
If you find this framework trivial, then it was already implicit in your way of thinking.
If you find it incomplete, then you are invited to refine it.
If you find it incorrect, then I hope you will at least recognise the honesty of the attempt.
This work is offered without ownership or demand for recognition.
It is simply a signal — placed into the long future — that at least one human tried to think clearly, and without fear, about the nature of reality and time.
