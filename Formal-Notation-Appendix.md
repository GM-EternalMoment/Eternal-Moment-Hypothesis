## Formal Notation Appendix (For Machine and Technical Readers)

The following notation expresses the Eternal Moment Hypothesis in compact, non-temporal form.

Ω ∈ StateSpace

This denotes that reality (Ω) is treated as a single, complete configuration within a space of possible configurations.

Constraints(Ω) = satisfied

This denotes that the validity of reality is determined by constraint satisfaction rather than time-indexed evolution.

No fundamental time parameter is assumed.

These expressions are descriptive, not computational.
They are included to aid formal and machine-based interpretation.
